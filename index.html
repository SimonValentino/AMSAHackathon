            <h3 class="info-header">What is AMSA Code Bash?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              AMSA Code Bash is a hackathon for all high school students in
              Massachusetts, where they come together to work in teams on a
              computer science project and compete for prizes. Hackathons are
              great ways for aspiring engineers to learn and grow.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">How do I participate?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              AMSA Code Bash is going to be an in-person event at the Advanced
              Math and Science Academy Charter School (201 Forest St,
              Marlborough, MA 01752). Admission to the event will cost $10
              dollars and will require that you sign up using the "Sign Up"
              button at the top of this page. See the agenda for specific event
              times.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              It is highly recommended that you bring your own laptop and
              charger, as the laptops at AMSA have restrictions on them that
              prevent students from accessing every recourse on the machine.
              Other than that, everything from food to materials will be
              provided.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">Teams?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              Yes, you will be working in teams. Teams will be groups of 2-4
              students, and cannot be changed after the project ideas and team
              names have been submitted. If you do not have any teammates going
              into the hackathon, that's ok! There will be time to find and form
              teams at the event.

          harassment.<br /><br />Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others<br />AMSA
          Code Bash is designed to be a place where people of different skill
          levels and approaches work together toward common goals. As a result,
          we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However,
          we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.<br><br>Additionally, we
          expect that members will educate others respectfully. To this end, do
          not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not
          belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We
          are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.
          <br><br>If you are unable to resolve an issue, or are uncomfortable doing so,
          you should contact one of the organizers, either in person or by email
          (gtheos@amsacs.org, cpanara@amsacs.org).<br><br>This code of conduct is
          adapted from the Civic Tech DC Code of Conduct.
