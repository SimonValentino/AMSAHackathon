            <h3 class="info-header">What is AMSA Code Bash?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              AMSA Code Bash is a hackathon for all high school students in
              Massachusetts, where they come together to work in teams on a
              computer science project and compete for prizes. Hackathons are
              great ways for aspiring engineers to learn and grow.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">How do I participate?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              AMSA Code Bash is going to be an in-person event at the Advanced
              Math and Science Academy Charter School (201 Forest St,
              Marlborough, MA 01752). Admission to the event will cost $10
              dollars and will require that you sign up using the "Sign Up"
              button at the top of this page. See the agenda for specific event
              times.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              It is highly recommended that you bring your own laptop and
              charger, as the laptops at AMSA have restrictions on them that
              prevent students from accessing every recourse on the machine.
              Other than that, everything from food to materials will be
              provided.
            </p>
            <h3 class="info-header">Teams?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
              Yes, you will be working in teams. Teams will be groups of 2-4
              students, and cannot be changed after the project ideas and team
              names have been submitted. If you do not have any teammates going
              into the hackathon, that's ok! There will be time to find and form
              teams at the event.

          AMSA Code Bash is an event about empowering high school students to
          collaborate on computing projects that are personally meaningful and
          self directed. We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming
          space, without regard to gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual
          orientation, gender identity or expression, mental or physical
          disability, physical appearance, neuro(a)typicality, religion, level
          of knowledge, level of experience, socioeconomic status or background,
          political affiliation, or any other attribute.<br /><br />As
          organizers of this event, we believe that the below principles are
          essential to maintaining this environment. In addition, we believe
          that they are good principles for life in general. This Code of
          Conduct serves to ensure that everybody and anybody who wishes to
          participate is able to do so.<br /><br />Do Not Harass<br />Harassment
          is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any
          reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal
          comments related to personal characteristics or choices, deliberate
          intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or
          recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual
          publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or
          unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be
          harassment.<br /><br />Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others<br />AMSA
          Code Bash is designed to be a place where people of different skill
          levels and approaches work together toward common goals. As a result,
          we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However,
          we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.<br /><br />Additionally,
          we expect that members will educate others respectfully. To this end,
          do not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not
          belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We
          are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.
          <br /><br />If you are unable to resolve an issue, or are
          uncomfortable doing so, you should contact one of the organizers,
          either in person or by email (gtheos@amsacs.org,
          cpanara@amsacs.org).<br /><br />This code of conduct is adapted from
          the Civic Tech DC Code of Conduct.
